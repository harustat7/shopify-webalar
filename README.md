#Shopify Theme Customization
<h3>Overview</h3>
Contains custom modifications to key Liquid template files to enhance the user experience and conversion rate of the Shopify store. The modifications focus on improving product discovery, streamlining the shopping experience, and implementing best practices for e-commerce design.

<h3>Files Included</h3>
product-card.liquid: Enhanced product card with view functionality and improved visibility of product options
collection.liquid: Revised collection page with advanced filtering and sorting
index.liquid: Optimized homepage with featured collections and improved product showcasing
cart.liquid: Streamlined cart experience with cross-sell functionality

<h3>Implementation Details</h3>
<h5>Product Card </h5>
I implemented a modular product card that maintains consistent styling across the site while dynamically adapting based on where it's displayed (homepage, collection pages, or related products). Key features include:
Lazy-loaded images with proper aspect ratio maintenance
Quick-add functionality that works without page reload
Color/variant swatches that update the product image on hover
Strategic placement of product badges (sale, new, etc.)
Optimized mobile display with touch-friendly targets

Collection Page (collection.liquid)
The collection page has been redesigned to improve product discovery with:

AJAX-powered filtering and sorting that preserves URL parameters
Intelligent default sort based on inventory and popularity
Responsive grid that maintains proportions across viewports
Breadcrumb navigation with schema markup for SEO
Pagination with proper rel tags and load-more functionality

Homepage (index.liquid)
The homepage has been structured to balance promotional content with product discovery:

Dynamic hero section with customizable content blocks
Featured collections with custom scroll behavior on mobile
Recently viewed products section using localStorage
Newsletter signup with proper validation and error states
Performance optimizations for Core Web Vitals

Cart Page (cart.liquid)
The cart has been optimized for conversion with:

Real-time shipping calculator
Cross-sell recommendations based on cart contents
Persistent cart using localStorage
Clear inventory and availability messaging
Streamlined checkout flow with progress indicators

Testing Approach
All modifications were tested across multiple devices and browsers to ensure consistent functionality. Special attention was paid to:

Mobile responsiveness and touch interactions
Performance optimization (limiting DOM nodes, optimizing asset loading)
Accessibility standards (proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
Edge cases (empty states, error handling, etc.)

Future Enhancements
Areas identified for future improvement include:

Implementation of product reviews integration
Enhanced product recommendation algorithm
A/B testing different cart upsell approaches
Further performance optimizations for image loading
